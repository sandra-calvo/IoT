This lab will help you to identify anomalies in your historical time series data (IoT data) in simple steps. 
Also, derive the threshold value for your historical data. 
This threshold value can be used to set rules in Watson IoT Platform, such that you get an alert when your IoT device reports an abnormal reading in the future.

In order to find the anomalies, we are going to use IBM Watson Studio.
